# Module 15 Challenge - MechaCar

## Challenge Overview

The goals of this challenge are to:

- Design and interpret a multiple linear regression analysis to identify variables of interest.
- Calculate summary statistics for quantitative variables.
- Perform a t-test in R and provide interpretation of results.
- Design your own statistical study to compare vehicle performance of two vehicles.

## Resources

Data Sources: [MechaCar_mpg](data_source/MechaCar_mpg.csv), [Suspension_Coil](data_source/Suspension_Coil.csv)

Software: R

## Analysis

### MPG Regression

**Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?**

**Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?**

**Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?**

### Suspension Coil Summary

**Mean**

**Median**

**Variance**

**Standard deviation**

**Interpretation and findings**

*The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification? Why or why not?*

### Suspension Coil T-Test

**Interpretation and findings**

*Determine if the suspension coilâ€™s pound-per-inch results are statistically different from the mean population results of 1,500 pounds per inch.*

### Design Your Own Study

**Design a study that compares the performance of the MechaCar prototype vehicle to other comparable vehicles on the market**

write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar outperforms the competition. In your study design, be sure to write about the following considerations:

- Think critically about what metrics you would think would be of interest to a consumer (cost, fuel efficiency, color options, etc.).
- Determine what question we would ask, what the null and alternative hypothesis would be to answer that question, and what statistical test could be used to test this hypothesis.
- Knowing what test should be used, what data should be collected?
